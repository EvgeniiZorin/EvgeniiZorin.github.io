In my daily work, I use numerous diverse tools, languages, and libraries:
- Primary programming languages: **Python** and **Bash**
- I have experience and knowledge in **Machine Learning** in general, and tend to specialise in **NLP**
- When working with databases, I mainly use **SQL** with PostgreSQL and GCP BigQuery; additionally, I have some experience working with **noSQL** (document-oriented MongoDB, Elasticsearch and graph ArangoDB)
- I have extensive proficiency in **Data Visualisation** (Python, Power BI, Tableau); for instance, I can build and maintain complex **Dashboards** from concept to a live dashboard, using Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly and Plotly Dash)
- **(Big) Data Analysis** with Python (Pandas, PySpark)
