Here I would like to showcase all the resources that I have used for my **CPD (Continuous Professional Development)**. I enjoy learning new things related to my career in different ways:
- Doing online courses from websites such as Coursera, Udemy, FreeCodeCamp;
- Reading textbooks on topics in Data Science, Statistics, and Programming;
- Attending and participating in live events;

> Please note that this section is still being written, so there are many things that are not present here!

            <td><b>Grokking Machine Learning</b> - Luis Serrano, Manning Publications</td>
            <td>This book is an excellent introduction into the world of Machine Learning - it uses very simple examples to explain different ML algorithms and Gradient Boosting. I believe that this is the best book that a person can choose to start their journey into the world of ML.</td>
