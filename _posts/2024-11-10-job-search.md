In the middle of 2024, I was looking for a new job opportunity in the field of Data Science / Analytics and collected plenty of interesting data on the jobs available at that point. As a result, I produced some interesting visualisations on this topic that could be interesting to those interested to apply to a Data Scientist position.

# Application process

First, some facts on the application process:
- When I started applying, I was 27 years of age, with roughly 3 years of mixed experience in Data Science and Analytics;
- I have a BSc in Nutrition and MSc in Biotechnology (Bioinformatics);
- Over a period of 01.05.2024 - 16.07.2024 (roughly **2.5 months**), I made a total of **501 job applications**.
